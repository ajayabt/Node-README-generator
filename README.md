# Node README generator


## Description

This app has been developed to generate a README as a markdown file based on responses to set prompts in the CLI.


## Installation

This app can be run by cloning the repository and navigating to the local directory which contains the index.js file. From here, run 'node index.js'. This will initiate the program to run the prompts in the command line. Respond to the questions, upon completion, the message will read 'Successfully created generatedMarkdown.md'. This can file can be found in the same directory.


## Usage

This package can be run using the CLI. See above.




## Credits
We were provided with some starter code to structure the challenge. Inquirer is used which provides snippets to aid in deployment. Thanks to the bootcamp instructors and TAs who have enabled me to get this far.
